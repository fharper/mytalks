Personal Branding: it’s more important than you think

Why should you care about your personal brand? After all, it’s not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs and become a  “thought leader” in your industry. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to build a personal brand, and this presentation will help you learn how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goals. You don’t need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru— you can be yourself and get your dream job or reach the next level of your career.
